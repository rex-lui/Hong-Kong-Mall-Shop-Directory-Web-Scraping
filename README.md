## Objective
As working in mall leasing department of a sizable property company in Hong Kong, it is a good idea to montior the merchants leasing situation of competitor malls in ongoing basis. To monitor in a timely manner, this repository aims to develop a pipeline of web scraping procedure so it is easier to replicate and output the shop directory data.

## Setup
Run "export_data.ipynb" to export the malls' shop directory into "data" folder. By default, all malls will be extracted in one go. If you need to extract particular mall(s), you may amend "mall" variable to only include the desired mall(s).

## Method
Depending on the website design, different web scraping methods will be applied.
If the website is not java based, BeautifulSoup is mainly used in the web scraper.
Since shop list page usually does not contain the shop details, data in shop list page and shop detail page are scrapped separately then combined into a shop master data.
For the website which is java based, the designated website API will be called to have web scraping instead.

## Export data
In this project, there are two main functions (getShopCategory, getShopMaster) to extract the shop categories and shop master data from each mall. The data fields have been standardized among all malls. If no corresponding data could be extracted on the website, NULL will be placed in the fields.

Below is the definition of exported data set:
